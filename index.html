<h1>Rich Bastard</h1>

<p>For those of you who have ever played the card game <b>Billionaire</b> 
(or, as it is called these days, <b>Get Rich Quick</b>), this is an online
clone of that game, and the rules are the same.</p>

<p>For those who have not played the game, the rules are simple.</p>

<p>In this game there are eight commodities - Diamond, Gold, Oil, Property,
Mining, Shipping, Banking and Sport.  The goal is to control all 9 cards for
a single commodity.  You choose which one, and you win if you have nine of
them.</p>

<p>There, however, lurks the danger of the Tax Man - if you get this card,
it will stand in the way of your goal.  If you are unlucky enough to get the
Tax Man card, trade it away as soon as you can - it can be a wild card in any
trade you make, or you can try your luck and trade it on its own - but don't
be surprised if the other players catch on!</p>

<p>There is also the Rich Bastard card - it's a wild card as well, but unlike
the Tax Man card, it can stand in for any commodity card.  If you have it and
eight of the same type of commodity card, you win!  Keep this one close to
your chest!</p>
